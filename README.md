## COVID-19 'People - Resource Provider' Mapping App 

During this time of COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing the biggest crisis of our lifetimes. It seems like the sky has crashed down on the underprivileged sector of the society who aren't able to meet the basic needs. NGOs all across the country are trying their best to reach out to help yet, but they aren't able to provide support to everyone mostly because of a gap in communication.

The goal of this project is to:

* Make it possible for those in need to reach out for help at just a phone call/SMS.
* Develop and build algorithms that can automatically suggest and match them to the best resource providers (NGOs, Volunteers)

## Table of Contents: 

Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

## Installation: 

Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

## Usage: 

The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributing: 

Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

## Credits: 

Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

## License: 

Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
